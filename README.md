Attempt to make my own art generating ai

What I know:
  - We can use AI models to generate art from text
  
What I need to know:
  - What models are freely available to use? What are the most used

What I've learned so far:
  - CLIP (Contrastive Image-Learning Pretraining) is available and is the model behind DALL-E
  - VQGAN (Vector Quantized GAN) is a transformer image generator
  - Pixray
